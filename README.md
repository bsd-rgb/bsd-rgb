## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Brandi

Iâ€™m a junior software developer transitioning from IT support into full-stack development. My current toolkit includes Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PowerShell. Iâ€™m expanding my skills by learning React and strengthening my Java fundamentals as I prepare to dive into Spring.
